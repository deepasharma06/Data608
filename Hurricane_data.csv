The slow moving hurricane initially crossed Cape Fear during the late afternoon on the 26th, then pivoted northeast along the North Carolina coast during the evening. With part of the circulation center on land, the storm weakened to Catagory I storm in the early morning hours of the 27th before making landfall near the Onslow/Pender county line. The storm then continued to move slowly northeast at speeds of 10 mph or less. Bonnie was downgraded to a Tropical Storm during the afternoon of the 27th but later was reclassified as a Hurricane as she moved off Kitty Hawk late in the evening. Bonnie was a unique storm in that the strongest winds were not located around the center of circulation like a typical hurricane but encompassed a large area in the eastern semi-circle. The most damaging winds were contained in the precursor rain bands where localized downbursts produced siginficant damage...especially along the coast of Carteret county which appeared to sustain the most damage from the storm. The slow movement of the storm contributed to excessive rainfall amounts with totals of 7-10 inches common across eastern North Carolina. Since much of the region had experienced below normal rainfall during the  summer months,  the resulting flood was not as damaging as it could have been. The Southeast Cape Fear River in Duplin county had the most significant flooding with areas near Chinquapin reporting high water. Elsewhere flooding of poor drainage and low lying areas predominated. Coastal/Storm surge flooding  was not  as extensive as with Huuricanes Fran or Bertha but several locations did report significant problems. The hardest hit area was Belhaven where storm surge flooding along the Pungo River flooded 2/3rds of the homes in the area with water levels as high as 6 ft above normal. Other coastal flooding was reported in Manns Harbor and Stumpy Point in Dare county, Washington in Beaufort county, Near Hobucken in Pamlico county, Swansboro in Onslow county and along the south shore of the Albemarle sound in Washington and Tyrrell counties. Many docks, piers and bulkheads were damaged or destroyed by the storm. Along the Outer Banks, soundside flooding from the Pamlico Sound late on the 27th and early on the 28th produced water levels 4-6 feet above normal in Manteo on Roanoke Island and over portions of Hatteras Island where Route 12 was closed briefly due to high water. Storm surge at the beaches of Onslow and Carteret counties was generally 3-5 feet above normal with moderate beach erosion. North Topsail Beach lost most of the protective dunes constructed after the hurricanes of 1996. Tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef,  washed up on the shore of Bogue Banks. Wind damage was greatest along Bogue Banks where two hotels and one department store lost roofs. The Iron Steamer and Indian Beach piers sustained significant damage losing large sections due to the combination of wind and rough surf. The hurricane also produced 7 confirmed tornadoes during the afternoon and evening of the 26th. The heavy rains and strong winds also led to significant crop damage with Onslow county reporting over 110 million dollars in damages.

Most offshore oil rigs did evacuate, which accounted for as many as 10,000 people off the southwest Louisiana Gulf coast. Corp of Engineer Locks along the Intracoastal Waterway reported very heavy traffic from shrimp boats and other commercial fishing vessels moving inland when the hurricane watch was issued. Over 160 boats went through the Freshwater Bayou Lock in southeastern Vermilion Parish on September 1st.

Evacuations were called for in Cameron Parish, where over 5,000 people evacuated. Vermilion, Iberia, and St. Mary Parishes had only voluntary evacuations.

Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high water"" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day", exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.

Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S.

Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high water"" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day", exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.  They were hit at an intersection where the storm had knocked the power off and the stop lights were not working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S.

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

Information on parishes experiencing the most damage are listed below:

Jefferson Parish: Affects in the parish were mostly confined to minor wind damage to trees and house roofs, and loss of electrical power due to downed power lines.

An automated NOAA weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River recorded a maximum wind gust of 82 mph at 1653CST on September 27.  A storm surge of  7 to 8 feet was experienced along the east bank areas of the parish. A USGS tide gage in Gardene Bay east of Point a la Hache recorded a stage of 8.9 ft before power failed. Considerable storm surge flooding was recorded outside of the hurricane protection levees. About 50 homes and businesses outside of the levee system in the vicinity of Venice were reported to have flooded. Some wind damage to roofs, signs, and mobile homes also occurred within the levee protection system of southern Plaquemine Parish.  Power outages were widespread throughout the parish from the afternoon of September 27 through September 28.

The hurricane moved only slowly north during the morning hours, at times becoming nearly stationary. The hurricane finally was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1500CST on September 28 when it was located north of Biloxi. The tropical storm then moved very slowly eastward into southern Alabama on September 29. 

The greatest affect from the hurricane occurred over Jackson County which experienced the intense eastern portion of the hurricanes eyewall and highest storm surge.

Due to the slow forward speed of the hurricane very heavy rainfall occurred over eastern Harrison County and Jackson County leading to record flooding on streams and rivers. The barrier islands in the Mississippi Sound were also heavily damaged by wind and storm surge. A new three quarter mile cut developed in the east portion of Ship Island.  Total insured property damage in Mississippi was estimated at near 310 million dollars by insurance industry sources. When unisured losses and public property damage considered, total damages in Mississippi will likely approach $620 million.

Hancock County - Wind damage in Hancock County was mostly confined to large tree limbs snapped off, trees downed, and minor roof damage to houses and businesses, and damage to commercial signs. Storm surge was of minimal impact with the county remaining on the west side of the hurricane. Storm surge was 4 to 5 ft above normal with only minor coastal flooding and beach erosion occurring. Approximately 2,000 people were housed in public shelters.

Harrison County - Moderate wind damage occurred throughout the parish. Many commercial signs were damaged or destroyed, large trees limbs and trees downed, and wind damaged roofs or houses and businesses. At the Gulfport Harbor, a wind gage recorded a maximum gust of 80 mph at 0415CST on September 28.  At approximately the same time period, a gust to 117 mph was recorded in Gulfport, one mile north of the beach.  Storm surge flooding was generally 6 to 7 feet above normal across the coast. Storm surge flooding crossed US Highway 90 in several locations, but storm surge flooding to property was not considered major. A maximum stage of  8.1 ft was recorded at the Gulfport Harbor.

Due to the slow movement of the hurricane, heavy rain occurred over the east portion of the county and adjacent areas. Significant river flooding occurred on the Biloxi and Tchoutacabouffa Rivers on the September 28 and September 29.  Wortham, on the Biloxi River reached its second highest stage of record with a reading of 25.47 ft on September 29.  

Many county residents evacuated low lying areas in advance of the hurricane with approximately 3700 seeking refuge in public evacuation shelters within the county. 

Jackson County - Jackson County bore the brunt of Hurricane Georges with the area experiencing the strong right front quadrant of the hurricane's circulation. A storm surge of 8 to 11 feet caused storm surge flooding along low lying coastal areas. This was the greatest storm surge flooding in Jackson County in nearly 30 years. In the east beach section of the Bellefontaine area, 23 of 27 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed by storm surge. Many businesses and industries located in low lying coastal areas were flooded causing considerable property damage and loss of revenue. The U.S. Navy facility at Pascagoula suffered $2.2 million in property damage, primarily roof and water damage. 

Several unofficial anemometers recorded gusts between 85 and 100 mph in the Pascagoula area. Moderate wind damage was reported across the parish. Numerous commercial signs were destroyed, trees downed, roofs damaged, and power lines and poles downed. 

Approximately 4600 people sought refuge in public hurricane evacuation shelters in Jackson County. Two shelters, one in Gautier and one in Pascagoula, suffered wind damage to the roof at the height of the storm. 

Due to the slow forward speed of Hurricane Georges, widespread heavy rainfall occurred over Jackson County and over the watershed of the Pascagoula and Escatawpa Rivers. Rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was common over Jackson County. River flooding developed over much of the county by September 28. A record flood crest of 20.82 feet was established on Red Creek at Vestry. On the Escatawpa River, a record flood crest of 22.70 feet was established at Agricola.  Approximately 3,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas, primarily in the Escatawpa River basin, with hundreds of structures flooded in the county.

At the Gulfport Harbor, a wind gage recorded a maximum gust of 80 mph at 0415CST on September 28.  At approximately the same time period, a gust to 117 mph was recorded in Gulfport, one mile north of the beach.  Storm surge flooding was generally 6 to 7 feet above normal across the coast. Storm surge flooding crossed US Highway 90 in several locations, but storm surge flooding to property was not considered major. A maximum stage of  8.1 ft was recorded at the Gulfport Harbor.

Due to the slow movement of the hurricane, heavy rain occurred over the east portion of the county and adjacent areas. Significant river flooding occurred on the Biloxi and Tchoutacabouffa Rivers on the September 28 and September 29.  Wortham, on the Biloxi River reached its second highest stage of record with a reading of 25.47 ft on September 29.  

Many county residents evacuated low lying areas in advance of the hurricane with approximately 3700 seeking refuge in public evacuation shelters within the county. 

Jackson County - Jackson County bore the brunt of Hurricane Georges with the area experiencing the strong right front quadrant of the hurricane's circulation. A storm surge of 8 to 11 feet caused storm surge flooding along low lying coastal areas. This was the greatest storm surge flooding in Jackson County in nearly 30 years. In the east beach section of the Bellefontaine area, 23 of 27 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed by storm surge. Many businesses and industries located in low lying coastal areas were flooded causing considerable property damage and loss of revenue. The U.S. Navy facility at Pascagoula suffered $2.2 million in property damage, primarily roof and water damage. 

Several unofficial anemometers recorded gusts between 85 and 100 mph in the Pascagoula area. Moderate wind damage was reported across the parish. Numerous commercial signs were destroyed, trees downed, roofs damaged, and power lines and poles downed. 

Approximately 4600 people sought refuge in public hurricane evacuation shelters in Jackson County. Two shelters, one in Gautier and one in Pascagoula, suffered wind damage to the roof at the height of the storm. 

Due to the slow forward speed of Hurricane Georges, widespread heavy rainfall occurred over Jackson County and over the watershed of the Pascagoula and Escatawpa Rivers. Rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was common over Jackson County. River flooding developed over much of the county by September 28. A record flood crest of 20.82 feet was established on Red Creek at Vestry. On the Escatawpa River, a record flood crest of 22.70 feet was established at Agricola.  Approximately 3,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas, primarily in the Escatawpa River basin, with hundreds of structures flooded in the county.  

Pearl River County - Damage was mainly confined to downed tree limbs and trees, minor to moderate roof damage to homes and businesses, and power outages from downed power lines. Several secondary highways and roadways in the county were blocked by fallen trees. Storm total rainfall was fairly light with amounts of 2 to 4 inches common. About 200 people were sheltered in public hurricane evacuations shelters in the county.",157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27, it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast just to the east of Biloxi, MS at 0400 CST on September 28. The hurricane moved only slowly north during the morning hours, at times becoming nearly stationary. The hurricane finally was downgraded to a tropical storm at 1500CST on September 28 when it was located north of Biloxi. The tropical storm then moved very slowly eastward into southern Alabama on September 29. 

The greatest affect from the hurricane occurred over Jackson County which experienced the intense eastern portion of the hurricanes eyewall and highest storm surge.

Due to the slow forward speed of the hurricane very heavy rainfall occurred over eastern Harrison County and Jackson County leading to record flooding on streams and rivers. The barrier islands in the Mississippi Sound were also heavily damaged by wind and storm surge. A new three quarter mile cut developed in the east portion of Ship Island.  Total insured property damage in Mississippi was estimated at near 310 million dollars by insurance industry sources. When unisured losses and public property damage considered, total damages in Mississippi will likely approach $620 million.

Hancock County - Wind damage in Hancock County was mostly confined to large tree limbs snapped off, trees downed, and minor roof damage to houses and businesses, and damage to commercial signs. Storm surge was of minimal impact with the county remaining on the west side of the hurricane. Storm surge was 4 to 5 ft above normal with only minor coastal flooding and beach erosion occurring. Approximately 2,000 people were housed in public shelters.

The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

Information on parishes experiencing the most damage are listed below:

Jefferson Parish: Affects in the parish were mostly confined to minor wind damage to trees and house roofs, and loss of electrical power due to downed power lines.

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

By 5 am the hurricane was about 100 miles south southwest of Cape Lookout.  By 1 pm the hurricane quickly moved to 75 miles south of Cape Hatteras and was downgraded to a Category I Hurricane.  By 11 pm Tuesday, August 31st the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm with a position of about 105 miles west of Cape Hatteras.  Tropical Storm Dennis was drifting at 4 mph and would remain in this quasi-stationary position for the next few days...only to return to eastern North Carolina and make landfall on September 4th along the Core Banks just north of Cape Lookout.

As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.  

Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.  

Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area.

Extreme flooding was experienced across most counties.  Inland flooding exceeded Hurricane Bertha...Fran...Bonnie... and Dennis combined.  Most counties reported their worst flooding ever.  The Tar River in Greenville and the Neuse River in Kinston were nearly 15 feet above their flood stages of 13 and 14 feet, respectively.  The Tar River remained above flood stage for nearly two weeks while the Neuse River remained above flood stage for over a month.  The Northeast Cape Fear River in Chinquapin was 8 to 10 feet above the flood stage of 13 feet.  The Roanoke River in Williamston rose to nearly 3 feet above its flood stage.  Unbelievable numbers of homes were covered with water and over half a million customers throughout the county warning area were without power.  In Greenville alone a 100 acre parcel of land would be needed to store all the mobile homes that were destroyed due to flooding.  Unofficially the flooding from Hurricane Floyd has been compared to a 500 year flood.  At least 13 fatalities have been reported during the event in the 15 county warning area.  Unfortunately, a majority of the deaths could have been avoided had the victims not driven through flooded roadways.  As with most hurricanes, inland flooded is now responsible for the largest percentage of  fatalities.",280,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At one time Floyd was classified as a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson scale and will likely be categorized as one of the nation's most costly hurricanes in the 20th century.

Tropical Depression number eight was detected by the National Hurricane Center at 1600 EST on September 7th.  The broad center was nearly 1000 miles west of the Lesser Antilles.  At that time the depression was moving toward the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph.  Within 12 hours the depression gained strength, became a tropical storm, and was named Floyd.  As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.  

Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.  

Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area.

Extreme flooding was experienced across most counties.  Inland flooding exceeded Hurricane Bertha...Fran...Bonnie... and Dennis combined.  Most counties reported their worst flooding ever.

As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area.

Extreme flooding was experienced across most counties.  Inland flooding exceeded Hurricane Bertha...Fran...Bonnie... and Dennis combined.  Most counties reported their worst flooding ever.  The Tar River in Greenville and the Neuse River in Kinston were nearly 15 feet above their flood stages of 13 and 14 feet, respectively.  The Tar River remained above flood stage for nearly two weeks while the Neuse River remained above flood stage for over a month.  The Northeast Cape Fear River in Chinquapin was 8 to 10 feet above the flood stage of 13 feet.  The Roanoke River in Williamston rose to nearly 3 feet above its flood stage.  Unbelievable numbers of homes were covered with water and over half a million customers throughout the county warning area were without power.  In Greenville alone a 100 acre parcel of land would be needed to store all the mobile homes that were destroyed due to flooding.  Unofficially the flooding from Hurricane Floyd has been compared to a 500 year flood.  At least 13 fatalities have been reported during the event in the 15 county warning area.  Unfortunately, a majority of the deaths could have been avoided had the victims not driven through flooded roadways.

Hundreds of trees and power lines were blown down across interior southeast Virginia and the immediate Hampton Roads area, resulting in widespread power outages. The tidal departure at Sewells Point in Norfolk was 3.9 feet above normal or 6.4 feet above MLLW. This resulted in moderate to locally severe coastal flooding approximately 2 hours before high tide on the 16th. The tide gage in downtown Norfolk recorded a tide of 7.1 feet above MLLW. Flooding was more widespread during Hurricane Floyd due to extremely heavy rainfall before and during the peak storm tide. Storm surge flooding of 5 to 7 feet occurred over central portions of the Chesapeake Bay inundating sections of Accomack county. Some homes were flooded with 3 to 6 feet of water. The lowest sea level pressure recorded was 970 mb at Chesapeake Light (CHLV2).

Floyd will be remembered as an extremely wet hurricane for east-central Virginia. The presence of a stalled frontal boundary provided the focus for extremely heavy rains. Rainfall amounts averaged 10 to 20 inches in a 50 to 75 mile swath centered over the headwaters of the Chowan River Basin in interior southeast Virginia and northeast North Carolina extending into the middle peninsula. Numerous roads were washed out due to flooding. Primary routes out of service included US 460 near Wakefield, US 58 near Emporia and Franklin, and Interstate 95 south of Petersburg to Emporia.",332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around nine inches, most of which fell in a twelve hour period from the early morning through the afternoon on the 16th.  Two girls (an eleven-year-old and a twelve-year-old) drowned when they were swept into a 1,500 foot culvert in Red Lion (New Castle County) during the afternoon of the 16th. An 8-year-old girl who was with them managed to pull herself from the culvert.  These were the first hurricane related deaths in the state since Hazel in 1954.   The highest verifiable storm total was 10.58 inches in Greenwood (Sussex County).  This established a new 24 hour state record.  A number of other stations also broke the old state record of 7.83 inches set on June 27, 1938 including the New Castle County Airport (8.29 inches). Based on Doppler Radar storm totals estimate the heaviest rain fell across southern New Castle County.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period for New Castle County as record crests were set on many rivers and streams.  Hundreds of roads and bridges were closed.  About 300 people were evacuated to shelters, mainly in New Castle and Sussex Counties. Two people were seriously injured.  Dozens more were rescued from trapped vehicles. The combination of winds funneling into Delaware Bay and the runoff from inland waterways produced minor tidal flooding at the times of high tide in New Castle and Kent Counties.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees across the state, especially in the wooded areas of New Castle County.  About 25,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was restored by the 19th.  A state of emergency was declared on the 16th and all schools were closed. The preliminary damage estimate was 8.42 million dollars.  President Clinton declared New Castle County a disaster area.     

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west,    it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a large sized hurricane that prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled just west of Chesapeake Bay on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front and then rode north along the boundary.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived just after midnight on the 16th and reached northern Delaware by 5 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was still offshore south of North Carolina.  Floyd made its initial landfall during the early morning hours of the 16th at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina and accelerated as it proceeded northeast.   Damaging east winds arrived in Sussex County by 3 a.m. EDT almost coinciding with the torrential rain.  Meanwhile a weakened Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware during the mid afternoon.  Eyewitness reports stated that the western part of the eye brushed the island.   By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic, although damaging winds continued.  Between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.  At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.   But in some cases (especially in New Castle County), the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.  The strong winds persisted through the evening of the 16th.  Wind  gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easy for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Floyd hit New Castle County the hardest as the preliminary damages estimates for the county reached 8 million dollars.  One hundred twenty-seven homes in the state suffered minor damage, 83 were in New Castle County.  All the 44 homes with major damage and 33 homes that were condemned were in New Castle County. The hardest hit community within the county was Glenville (near Stanton) along the White Clay Creek.  About 100 homes were flooded with up to six feet of water.  During the height of the storm forty roads and bridges were closed including sections of Delaware State Routes 1 and 9. Flooding from Floyd washed away a 200 foot stretch of roadway and embankment of the Silver Lake Bridge.  The contents of the lake went down the Appoquinimink River.  The road was scheduled to be reopened in Mid December.  At about 730 p.m. EDT flooding along the Red Clay Creek washed out two bridges and extensively damaged three others used by the Wilmington Western Railroad (Delaware's oldest) near Prices Corner.  Miles of track, trestles and road beds suffered extensive damage estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Full service was not expected to be restored until the summer of 2000.  Residents in low-lying areas in Wilmington were asked to evacuate.  Flooding occurred and included the Gander Hill Prison.  High winds also pulled down numerous trees in the county.  One tree fell through and damaged the Center for the Creative Arts in Yorklyn.

Damage in Kent County was more widely scattered.  Delaware State Routes 6 and 9 flooded from both the combination of heavy rain and also tides near the bay.  Woodland Beach was cut off from mid afternoon until 9 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  The St. Jones River flooded in Dover.  One house in Dover lost a 38-foot-long section of a foundation.  The bridge on Delaware State Route 8 near Marydel was damaged and not reopened until the 24th.  Several roads were closed around Smyrna and Clayton from the combination of flooding and downed trees. A downed tree damaged at least one house in Dover.     

The worst damage from Floyd in Sussex County occurred inland.  Serious flooding problems were reported in Bridgeville, Greenwood and Seaford.  Seventy-five percent of downtown Greenwood was submerged under four feet of water.  The Seaford Apartments (the elderly) in Seaford were evacuated.  The parking lot became inaccessible.  In Laurel, a 12-year-old boy was swept into a drainage ditch and carried for half a mile before he was rescued and treated for hypothermia.  In South Bethany (because of no dune protection) and Lewes voluntary evacuations of low-lying areas were recommended.  But damage along the ocean was minimal.  Some beach dune fencing was blown down and minor erosion occurred.  Minor tidal flooding occurred along the bayside streets. State Routes 1, 54 and 56 had water on them during high tide.  

The Christina River at Coochs Bridge reached its 9 foot flood stage at 7 a.m. EDT on the 16th, crested at a RECORD BREAKING 13.9 feet at 430 p.m. EDT.  The White Clay Creek at Delaware Park (Stanton) reached its 13 foot flood stage  at 10 a.m. EDT on the 16th, crested at a RECORD BREAKING 17.6 feet    at 9 p.m. EDT and was back within bankfull at 4 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The Red Clay Creek at Wooddale reached its 5.5 flood stage at 11 a.m. EDT on the 16th and crested at a RECORD BREAKING 13.9 feet at 7 p.m. EDT on the 16th.   The Brandywine Creek at Wilmington reached its 11 foot flood stage at 4 p.m. EDT on the 16th and came within .1 of a foot of tieing the record flood stage when it crested at 15.4 feet.  The tide gage at Reedy Point (New Castle County) peaked at 7.5 feet above mean lower low water at 406 p.m. EDT.  Minor tidal flooding starts at 7 feet above mean lower low water. Storm totals included 10.58 inches in Greenwood (Sussex County - a new state record), 9.75 inches at the Porter Reservoir (New Castle County), 9.49 inches in Newark (New Castle County), 9.18 inches in Wilmington (New Castle County), 8.84 inches in Bear (New Castle County), 8.44 inches at the Dover AFB (Kent County), 8.29 inches at the New Castle County Airport, 7.27 inches in Bridgeville (Sussex County), 6.20 inches in Milford (Sussex County) and 6.11 inches in Georgetown (Sussex County).   The highest wind gusts included 64 mph at the Pilot Tower (Sussex County), 60 mph at the Delaware Bay Buoy and 46 mph at the New Castle County Airport.  Another unwanted side effect from Floyd was extra mosquitoes.",391,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as It's gone."""," ""It's totaled."""," ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2",000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County,3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as It's gone."""," ""It's totaled."""," ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2",000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County,3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as It's gone."""," ""It's totaled."""," ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2",000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County,3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Irene moved north across western Cuba on October 14 and strengthened to hurricane intensity early on October 15 in the Straits of Florida.  It then made its first landfall in south Florida in the lower Florida Keys around 9 AM EDT, October 15.  After crossing Florida Bay the center of Irene made landfall on the peninsula near Cape Sable around 4 PM EDT, October 15 as a Category One intensity hurricane.  It moved northeast across central Miami-Dade and Broward counties before exiting into the Atlantic just after midnight EDT on October 16 near Jupiter in northeast Palm Beach County.

Heavy rains and sustained winds of tropical storm force caused widespread flooding and power outages in the metropolitan areas of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.  The effects were similar, although somewhat more widespread, than those experienced in tropical storm Gordon in November 1994 and were reminiscent of the wet hurricanes in the 1930s and 1940s.

Rainfall totals in southeast Florida ranged from 6 to 17 inches with many areas getting 10 to 15 inches.  The greatest reliable amount reported was 17.45 inches at Boynton Beach.  The highest sustained wind over land was 60 mph at Miami Beach with many readings from 40 to 55 mph.  Fowey Rocks Light reported sustained winds of 66 mph while the Miami NWS doppler radar estimated areas of sustained hurricane force winds in the Atlantic Ocean just off the southeast Florida coast.  Among the highest recorded gusts were readings of 93 mph near Belle Glade, 85 mph at Homestead Air Reserve Base, 84 mph at Fowey Rocks Light, 74 mph at Turkey Point nuclear power plant and 70 mph at Miami International Airport.  The lowest barometric pressure on the south Florida peninsula was 989.9 mb at Opa Locka Airport.  Storm surge and beach erosion were minimal.

Four tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach counties, injuring 3 persons.  Several other areas of localized wind damage were reported, especially near the southeast shore of Lake Okeechobee, and were likely attributable to convective downbursts.

There were no direct deaths from Irene, but eight persons died in the aftermath.  Five persons were electrocuted by downed power lines, including three persons from one family.  Three other persons drowned in vehicle-related accidents.  Damage in southeast Florida, mainly from flooding is estimated near $600 million which includes $335 million in agricultural losses.  An estimated 700,000 customers lost electricity.  Flooding in a few residential areas lasted for a week displacing several hundred persons and isolating thousands more.

Other long-term ecological repercussions may be experienced from the flooding rains such as the effects of high water on Everglade's hammocks, and the effects of excessive fresh-water runoff on estuaries.",395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lowest barometric pressure on the south Florida peninsula was 989.9 mb at Opa Locka Airport.  Storm surge and beach erosion were minimal.

Four tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach counties, injuring 3 persons.  Several other areas of localized wind damage were reported, especially near the southeast shore of Lake Okeechobee, and were likely attributable to convective downbursts.

There were no direct deaths from Irene, but eight persons died in the aftermath.  Five persons were electrocuted by downed power lines, including three persons from one family.  Three other persons drowned in vehicle-related accidents.  Damage in southeast Florida, mainly from flooding is estimated near $600 million which includes $335 million in agricultural losses.  An estimated 700,000 customers lost electricity.  Flooding in a few residential areas lasted for a week displacing several hundred persons and isolating thousands more.

Irene moved north across western Cuba on October 14 and strengthened to hurricane intensity early on October 15 in the Straits of Florida.  It then made its first landfall in south Florida in the lower Florida Keys around 9 AM EDT, October 15.  After crossing Florida Bay the center of Irene made landfall on the peninsula near Cape Sable around 4 PM EDT, October 15 as a Category One intensity hurricane.  It moved northeast across central Miami-Dade and Broward counties before exiting into the Atlantic just after midnight EDT on October 16 near Jupiter in northeast Palm Beach County.

Heavy rains and sustained winds of tropical storm force caused widespread flooding and power outages in the metropolitan areas of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.  The effects were similar, although somewhat more widespread, than those experienced in tropical storm Gordon in November 1994 and were reminiscent of the wet hurricanes in the 1930s and 1940s.

Rainfall totals in southeast Florida ranged from 6 to 17 inches with many areas getting 10 to 15 inches.  The greatest reliable amount reported was 17.45 inches at Boynton Beach.  The highest sustained wind over land was 60 mph at Miami Beach with many readings from 40 to 55 mph.  Fowey Rocks Light reported sustained winds of 66 mph while the Miami NWS doppler radar estimated areas of sustained hurricane force winds in the Atlantic Ocean just off the southeast Florida coast.

At 500 pm on Monday November 15 a  hurricane watch was issued for all the U.S. Virgin Islands. The forecast track during that time showed Hurricane Lenny moving across Puerto Rico Wednesday afternoon. At 1100 pm the watch was upgraded to a warning.  By Tuesday afternoon, Lenny was located about 240 miles southwest of Puerto Rico and the first rainbands began to affect the islands.  During Tuesday night and most of Wednesday, Lenny continued to move east-northeast and by Wednesday afternoon Lenny was just 20 miles south of St. Croix.  Later that evening it  became nearly stationary at about 50 miles east of St. Croix until Thursday afternoon where it began to weaken and move to the northeast away from the local region.  By that time, all the watches and warnings for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands had been  discontinued.  

St. Croix suffered most of the damage.  Large battering waves and the sea surge produced extensive beach erosion and coastal flooding along the west coast of St. Croix. Widespread flooding occurred around the island.  Some sectors in St. Croix received between 5 to 8 inches of rain from Tuesday through Thursday.  Hurricane force winds caused roofs and window damage and downed power lines and poles.  In addition many boats sunk or washed ashore.  Official reports from St. Croix Airport indicated maximum sustained winds of 69 mph on November 18 and maximum peak gusts of 92 mph on November 17.  At St. Thomas airport,  the maximum sustained wind was 53 mph on November 17 and a maximum wind gust of 70 mph was reported on November 18.  An unofficial observer at Maria Hill in St. Croix reported maximum sustained winds of 83 mph with wind gust to 112 mph on Novermber 17.

Its closest point from Puerto Rico was about 75 miles south-southeast of Maunabo and Vieques on Wednesday morning.  By Wednesday afternoon, Lenny was just 20 miles south of St. Croix. Later that evening it became nearly stationary at about 50 miles east of St. Croix until Thursday afternoon where it began to weaken and move to the northeast away from the local region.  By that time, all the watches and warnings for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands had been discontinued. 

The south coast of Puerto Rico suffered some beach erosion, but its major impact across Puerto Rico was the flooding associated with the rainbands.  Some sectors in the east received more than seven inches of rain in a 48 hour period.  This caused many roads to become impassable and many rivers to overflow their banks, flooding low lying areas and forcing communities to be evacuated.  In addition, landslides, rock slides and mud slides were reported along the interior and west sections.  Maximum sustained wind speed at the San Juan airport was 33 mph with gusts up to 39 mph.  In Ceiba, the maximum sustained wind speed was 33 mph with gusts to 48 mph.  These winds knocked down several power lines leaving 22,000 residents without electricity.  

Hurricane Lenny's heavy rains caused about 200 farmers in the southeast to lose more than 13 million dollars in production.  More than 80% of the vegetables and 50% of the plantains in the region were lost due to rainfall Tuesday and Wednesday.",455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its major impact over Puerto Rico was flooding. Some sectors in the interior received more than 12 inches of rain in a 48-hour period.  This caused widespread flooding and many rivers to overflow  their banks forcing communities to be evacuated.  Also this rainfall caused landslides and mudslides and induced various bridges to collapse. Many homes were affected by flood waters island wide.   Maximum sustained wind speed at the San Juan Airport was 24 mph with gusts to 35 mph. In Ceiba, maximum sustained winds were 28 mph with gust to 35 mph.  Damages were estimated around .5 M due to flooding affecting about 406 homes.  Caguas municipality was the most affected with 237 families reporting some degree of  flood damage.",473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
