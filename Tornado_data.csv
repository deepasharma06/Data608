A powerful winter storm brought flooding rain, high winds, and a tornado to the Upstate from the evening of the 7th into the early morning of the 8th. Rainfall between 4 and 7 inches during a 2-day period across the mountains and foothills resulted in significant flooding. Many roads and bridges were covered or washed out. A wash out in Pickens county resulted in one fatality. Thunderstorms raced north through the area adding to the deluge as well as creating or enhancing strong to damaging winds. An F2 tornado touched down near Easley. Meso-scale high winds behind the complex of thunderstorms moved across the northern half of Greenville county and blew down trees and power lines. Severe thunderstorm winds combined with strong gradient winds to down trees and power lines in York county as well.",13,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The action started off with high winds and then heavy rain on the sixth.  Rainfall up to three inches caused widespread flooding, stranding motorists, and resulting in sporadic road closures.  The most serious flooding occurred in Newport Beach and Irvine during the early afternoon.  Several Newport  schools had flooded classrooms and were evacuated.  In Irvine, water and mud rushing through Bommer Canyon flooded 25 townhomes and a city park.  Lightning also struck a home in Irvine, blowing out windows, damaging the roof, and causing a gas line rupture.  In Dana Point, a tree-covered hillside slid into a hotel parking structure, submerging at least six cars in rock and sand.  Local State of Emergencies were declared in San Clemente, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, and Irvine.  Elsewhere throughout the valley areas of southwest California, several mud slides closed roads and blocked drainage channels, exacerbating the already high water levels.  Numerous swift-water and standing-water rescues were made as water quickly surrounded homes and cars. Gusty winds easily pushed over trees whose shallow root systems were anchored in water-logged soil, damaging homes and automobiles, and causing sporadic power outages.  Sink holes began to open up, undermining some roadways.  Over two inches of rain along the San Diego River late on the seventh and early on the eighth, sent the river out of it's banks.  It crested at 12.5 feet at Fashion Valley during the morning of the eighth, which is 1.2 feet above flood stage.

This was the final in a series of heavy storms which pummelled the region this month.  In many areas the ground was nearly saturated and some reservoirs were nearing or exceeding their capacity.  The two, to locally five inches of rain which ensued, caused widespread flooding and property damage, prompting the President to declare all four counties Federal Disaster Areas.  Strong winds gusting over 40 mph at times felled trees, whose support was weakened in the water-logged soils, which snapped utility lines, resulting in sporadic power outages.  Snow levels dropped as low as 1400 feet in the high deserts of San Bernardino County and wind gusts to 60 mph knocked out power to thousands.  In the mountains, 1 to 2 feet of heavy, wet snow above 6000 feet, snapped tree branches and power lines.   Above 7000 feet, 3 to 4 feet of snow fell.  In Laguna Beach, two hillsides gave way, sending a river of mud and water through homes and cars.  Two men were killed and at least two others injured, and three hundred homes were damaged, 18 of them seriously.  In Apple Valley and Hesperia, flooding caused major damage to scores of homes, while hundreds of homes and businesses in other communities suffered minor damage.  In Apple Valley alone, two dozen families were evacuated, and damage to public and private property reached $10 million.  Parts of 74 roads had to be closed throughout the Victor Valley.  Many roads, rail lines, and bridges were damaged or had to be closed for a time, including I-15 through the Cajon Pass.  Dangerous swift-water rescues occurred in Colton, Pedley, Canyon Lake, Redlands, Sun City and San Jacinto.  In San Diego County, 200 people were evacuated from three mobile home parks in Oceanside, and portions of Camp Pendleton were flooded, due to the raging Loma Alta Creek.  Numerous sink holes developed.  One near the I-15 and Balboa Avenue in San Diego, measured 550 feet long, 35 feet wide, and 65 feet deep.  The San Diego River at Fashion Valley peaked at 15.1 feet at 4:00 am on the twenty-fourth, which is 3.8 feet above flood stage.  For the third time this month, low lying roads, golf courses, and parking facilities were inundated.  

The persistent wet weather damaged the strawberry crop, assorted winter vegetables, citrus and avocado groves, and hurt the flower industry in San Diego County, but losses to dairymen in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties was staggering.  Thousands of cows succumbed to the weather.  Some drowned, others died of exhaustion and fatigue from struggling through 3 to 4 feet of mud, and many lost calves.  

Damage estimates to residences, businesses, property, infrastructure, agriculture, and the cost of emergency services, and for clean-up for all four counties exceeded $100 million.  While a large percentage of this figure is attributable to this storm, some portion was the result of previous storms this month.  The environment that these storms created, helped facilitate the runoff and subsequent flooding which ensued during this final storm of the month.   

Toward the end of the storm, a small tornado touched down in Huntington Beach at the Villa Huntington Mobile Estates.  A carport and children's playroom was ripped up.  Flying debris hit a transformer, knocking out power to 200 homes and a portion of a roof settled atop a tree one quarter mile away.  Later that morning a waterspout was sighted off of Mission Beach.",119,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ground survey indicated that the tornado moved northeast across Lake-In-The-Water Road and caused sporadic minor damage to the roofs of a few homes and downed trees and branches in the Oakwood Drive subdivision.  The tornado continued northeast, widened to 250 yards and intensified to F2 strength where it destroyed or severely damaged several structures along Doherty Drive.

Two mobile homes that took a direct hit from the F2 tornado along Doherty Drive were completely disintegrated with only frame rails and tie downs intact.  Meanwhile, in close proximity to the crushed mobile homes, a well-built home, with rebar-poured concrete, reinforced cinder block walls and a hip roof, suffered minor structural and roofing tile damage after taking a direct hit by the F2 tornado on Doherty Drive.  A pick-up truck parked adjacent to the well-built home was pushed 30 feet from its original resting place by the tornadic wind.

Residents along Doherty Drive reported the sound of the tornado resembled that of a large freight train.  One severely injured resident on Doherty Drive was tossed over 50 feet into the street from his mobile home that was destroyed by the tornado.

A storage facility with unsupported cinder block walls and a high unsupported roof span was demolished by the tornadic wind.  Tornado ground survey indicated that a large ten foot plus wide wood door entrance failed and allowed the tornadic wind to enter the commercial structure and exert extreme pressure on the outer load bearing walls which collapsed outward.

Aerial survey indicated that the tornado weakened to F1 strength and continued northeast across rural pasture and semi-wooded swampland where it caused severe damage to a few mobile homes, barns, fences and sheds before it crossed State Road 60, one quarter mile west of Tiger Lake Road, or 11.5 miles east of Lake Wales.

The tornado downed large power lines along State Road 60 and continued northeast where it snapped tree tops and branches before it lifted and dissipated along the southwest shore of Lake Kissimmee.

Summary of events of March 30th:

A line of thunderstorms formed along a cold front as it moved east across central and southern Oklahoma. The line extended across the state from Kansas to Texas and produced large hail, damaging winds, and one tornado.  The largest hail (golf ball-sized) was reported in Hickory in Murray County. Widespread wind damage occurred in Chickasha in Grady County as one storm evolved into a bow-echo.  As the line of storms continued to move east, they developed comma-head radar signatures.  One of these storms produced a small tornado (F0) in Lamar in Hughes County.

The main weather threat with the storms was hail with numerous reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail.  Hail covered the ground south of Waterloo.  Hail of nearly golf ball size fell just west of Des Moines near Waukee.  Though there were gusty winds associated with the storms, very few locations reported severe winds.  There were several reports of high winds over southeast Iowa.  Most of the wind reports came from Wapello, Mahaska, and Davis Counties.  One report of 60 MPH winds was received in Wapello County at Eddyville.  Winds of 70 MPH were reported over eastern Davis County, where a barn was destroyed, and in Mahaska County where damage occurred in New Sharon.  The line of storms did produce one tornado.  The tornado touched down briefly west of Ottumwa, damaging a house there.",206,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Ham radio spotter reported a brief touch down near Highway 169 in Webster County south of Dayton.  Another brief touchdown occurred in Green County north of Scranton near the same time.  All of these tornadoes touched down in open fields and caused little to no damage.  They were also quite small and weak.  The other problem during this event was with the rainfall.  The soil in Iowa was already close to saturation.  As a result, much of the rain that fell ran off, causing local and urban flooding.  Rainfall of one to three inches was common from west central Iowa into parts of the north central counties.  The heaviest rainfall report was received from Denison with 3.40 inches.  There were several reports of one to two inches falling in one half hours time.  In spite of the wet soil conditions and heavy rainfall, flooding was relatively minor, though considerable ponding did occur.",234,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This flow brought moisture north with surface dew point temperatures rising into the low to mid 50s.  Lapse rates were steep with the freezing level only around 9000 feet.  The low freezing level contributed to widespread hail as thunderstorms formed during the mid afternoon hours.  Synoptically, an upper level low pressure system was advancing northeast from the southwest U.S.  A surface low formed over Oklahoma with a trough extending northeast into eastern Nebraska.  This trough served as the focusing boundary for the thunderstorms to form on.  Initially , a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over southeast Nebraska and moved into southwest and west central Iowa.  Most of the storms produced at least pea to marble size hail.  There were several reports of hail covering the ground.   In Carroll County, pea to slightly larger size hail accumulated to a depth of an inch in the town of Arcadia.

At about the same time, half a mile to the north of the first tornado, another tornado formed and touched down.  It destroyed a mobile home (F2 intensity) and then travelled to the northeast causing spotty damage, mainly to trees.  It destroyed a shed 5 miles north of Olney (Richland County) before lifting and dissipating.  In total 8 people sustained minor injuries.  Damage in Clay County was estimated around $2.2 million and no damage estimate was available for Richland County.",332,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tornado touched down at 330 PM one mile west of Charlotte Pike and I-440.  A tree fell on an ROTC student at Centennial Park. He was attending an ROTC picnic. He died later on May 4 from his injuries.  The tornado went through downtown Nashville at 340 PM and on toward East Nashville, Donelson and Hermitage. The tornado blew out many windows on office buildings. The Nations Bank Office Towers were one of the hardest hit buildings in Nashville.  Tennessee Performance Arts Center (TPAC) and the Tennessee Towers  sustained damage. TPAC had over 100 windows blown out. NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts from the Tennessee Towers and was off the air for about 24 hours. 30 private airplanes were damaged at Cornelia Fort Airport. Estimated damage to the airplanes was 3 million dollars.  35 buildings in downtown Nashville were red tagged""", meaning these buildings were structurally unsound.  Many signs in Davidson county were blown down or severely damaged. The tornado blew down 3 out of 10 construction cranes on the construction site of the Tennessee Oiler's Football Stadium near the Cumberland River. The tornado continued east and hit the residential section of East Nashville. At least 300 homes were damaged in East Nashville. Many homes lost a good part of their roofs, trees were uprooted, telephone poles were knocked down. St. Ann's  Episcopal Church, which is well over 100 years old, received major damage. Uprooted trees, damaged roofs to many homes was the story across Donelson and Hermitage. Numerous windows were blown out from the Gaylord Building in Donelson. About half the trees, that is over a thousand trees, were blown down at Andrew Jackson's home, The Hermitage. The Hermitage is a 600 acre estate of the former President. Some of those trees were well over 200 years old, and a few of those trees that were destroyed were planted by Andrew Jackson himself. Mayor Phil Bredesen closed downtown Nashville of Friday, April 17. Many workers had an unscheduled holiday. The downtown area was reopened Monday, April 20. This gave time for cleanup crews to remove broken glass and repair downed power lines.  Nashville Electric Service said 75,"000 customers were without power.""",,351

Plentiful sunshine during the afternoon allowed for rapid destablization, and a number of severe thunderstorms developed near the warm front.  Thunderstorm activity was mostly multicellular in nature.

The first severe thunderstorm of the day crossed Saginaw and Midland Counties, and produced dime-sized hail in the city of Saginaw.  A car was struck by lightning just north of the Zilwaukee Bridge on I-75, damaging ham radio equipment and flattening a tire.  A separate storm blew over a corn crib in eastern Shiawassee County, while spotters reported severe winds with another thunderstorm in Fenton.  The Fenton storm then produced golfball-sized hail and downed trees east of Holly.

A northwest-southeast oriented band of thunderstorms developed in the Thumb area, and these storms provided the majority of severe weather during the late afternoon hours.  Most of the storms within this band were pulse-type storms, producing dime-sized hail and severe downbursts at isolated locations.  A strong downburst took place in eastern Tuscola County, where a horse barn was leveled, trees were uprooted, siding of a nearby house and garage was damaged, and a children's swing set was wrapped around a tree.  The same decaying storm moved into Evergreen Township in Sanilac County, where it heavily damaged a barn and tore the roofing off of a shed.  An isolated storm behind this band produced some dime-sized hail in Lapeer.

The southernmost storm of this band would become the most potent storm of the day.  It acquired supercell characteristics as it moved east across Sanilac County.  This storm first caused damage when it downed trees southeast of Sandusky.  Rotation in the storm continued to intensify, and a tornado formed between Carsonville and Applegate - the first tornado in Sanilac County since September 2, 1984.  The tornado had a continual damage path from its first touchdown until it moved out over Lake Huron at Port Sanilac.  Ping-pong to golfball-sized hail preceded the tornado by a few minutes from Carsonville to Port Sanilac.  Four homes, ten barns, five silos, and a grain bin were destroyed.  Twelve homes and six barns were damaged.  Significant damage was done to the public marina in Port Sanilac.  Two hundred people were left without power overnight.  There were no human casualties, but a horse had to be euthanised after it was seriously injured.

The supercell storm put out an outflow boundary, and an isolated severe thunderstorm developed along this boundary after the supercell had moved out over the open lake.  This last severe storm produced large hail along the St. Clair - Sanilac county line.",361,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary of events for May 6:

Numerous severe thunderstorms developed over eastern Oklahoma during the late afternoon and evening hours of May 6.  Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with some storms ultimately producing tornadoes.  

The first thunderstorms of the day developed over central Oklahoma and then moved eastward toward Okfuskee County after 430 PM CDT, traversing the counties along and just north of I-40 through 730 PM CDT before exiting into Arkansas to the east of Stilwell and Sallisaw.  These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.

Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  

Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.  At the time of the Calhoun tornado, the WSR-88D near Fort Smith had its first algorithm-induced tornado vortex signature (TVS).",439,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary of events for May 6 1998:

Numerous severe thunderstorms developed during the late afternoon and evening over eastern Oklahoma and then moved into westcentral and northwest Arkansas between 700 and 930 PM CDT.  Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with one storm ultimately producing a tornado.

The storm that produced a tornado was the first to move into Arkansas.  It first developed over Sequoyah County in Oklahoma and then moved into northern Crawford County around 715 PM CDT.  From there, it developed very rapidly and began rotating, finally producing a tornado touchdown near Lake Fort Smith.  Besides a tornado, this storm also produced hail to the size of golfballs.  

Another cluster of severe thunderstorms, with a history of brief tornado touchdowns and funnel clouds in Oklahoma, moved across northern Crawford County between 830 and 900 PM CDT.  Finally, a severe thunderstorm with a long history of rotation and tornadoes moved across southern Sebastian County between 900 and 930 PM CDT.  Thankfully, there were no known tornadoes in Sebastian County, but the storm produced hail as large as golfballs.  

The severe thunderstorms formed as a weak cold front shifted south over the area and a wave of low pressure approached from the west and southwest.  An upper level disturbance helped to break a cap of warm air in the mid-levels which had held firm for most of the day.",441,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The roof of a grocery store was damaged and debris from the store damaged cars and other buildings across the street at a dealership.,"Supercell thunderstorms developed in a highly sheared atmosphere in eastern Tennessee then moved east across the mountains, foothills and western piedmont of North Carolina. These long-lived, cyclic supercells produced a considerable amount of large hail and some damaging winds in the mountains. The first tornado of the day in western North Carolina occurred in Madison county. Numerous reports of hail as large as golf balls were reported from the mountains. In Madison and Yancey counties, hail covered roads. More supercell thunderstorms developed behind the previous ones and followed similar tracks. In northern Buncombe county, the town of Barnardsville had three separate severe storms cross overhead and drop hail on the ground to a depth of 3 inches. Yancey county also had 3 separate storms move across the county that accumulated hail to 6 inches in depth. The hail was still on the ground the next morning. 

As the supercells moved into the foothills, they began to curve a little to the right, indicative of strong mesocyclonic circulations present. One supercell produced several tornadoes from Alexander county to Davie county. Another storm produced a tornado that tracked from western Caldwell county into south-central Alexander county. A third supercell that emerged out of the mountains in McDowell county produced several tornadoes from the southern part of that county to northern Mecklenburg county. Damage was fairly significant across western North Carolina with numerous homes either damaged or destroyed. Fortunately, no one was killed. However, 2 people were injured as a result of the violent F4 tornado in eastern Caldwell county. One person received minor injuries from a lightning strike in Yancey county later in the evening.

The storms continued to reform in eastern Tennessee until very late in the evening and still produced large hail as they crossed the border into the mountain counties of North Carolina, before weakening shortly after midnight..",478,,,,,,,,,,,,,
